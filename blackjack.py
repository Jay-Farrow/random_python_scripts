# Task: Write a program that simulates the game of blackjack.

# Rules of Blackjack/21:
# Beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. If you get 21 points exactly on the deal, that is called a 'blackjack'
# Blackjack card values 'J', 'K', 'Q', 10 have a value of 10. 'A' has a value of 1 or 11. The rest of the card values are as they should be. 
# A face card combined with an 'A' is a blackjack(value of 21).
